NOTE: This repository should be considered read-only. For the Tcl Parser
component, the [tcl-parser](https://github.com/tcltk-depot/tcl-parser)
repository is recommended. For the debugger itself, use
[tcl-debugger](https://github.com/tcltk-depot/tcl-parser).

This repository is a fork of the Flightaware repository with updates
to support Tcl 9.

Original README from the Flightaware repository:

The TclPro Debugger version 2.0 is an upgrade of of the debugger included in the
TclPro product version 1.5 released and open-sourced by Scriptics Corporation.

To install: You will need to install the extension in lib/tclparser to add the parse command to Tcl.

    cd lib/tclparser && autoreconf && ./configure && make install

To run: execute the file bin/prodebug

The Help menu item on the Debugger's menu bar has an option to open the TclPro
user's guide, which will appear as a PDF file in the user's default browser.
The information in the chapter on the Debugger is still valid.

The debugger code has been upgraded to function with up-to-date releases of 
Tcl/Tk (i.e., versions 8.5, 8.6):

* Tk GUI code upgraded to work with current Tk API.

* Upgraded OS interaction code to work with current operating system releases.

* Instrumentation code added to accomodate the expand operator.

* Code added for proper custom instrumentation of new Tcl commands (e.g. apply,
dict, try) and subcommands.

* Put remote-debugging client code file into package for ease of access.

* Cleanup and correction of doc files.

* Files and directories re-arranged into starkit-ready format.

* Added script to wrap debugger code into a starkit of minimum size.

* Miscellaneous bug fixes.
